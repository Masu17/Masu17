# üí´ About Me:
My name is Samuel Y√∫nez Hern√°ndez, student of Multiplatform Application Development. I love exploring the world of programming and expanding my skills to create innovative solutions. <br><br>During the last year, I have been consolidating a good base, focusing mainly on Java being this my language of preference. However, throughout this year I wanted to expand my knowledge and focus on learning Python as an additional programming language to add to my tools as a developer. <br><br>In addition to my programming skills, I also have solid networking and system administration skills, which have helped me this year to facilitate learning tools like docker or Azure Cloud. <br><br>I am passionate about backend development, where I can leverage my use of logic and efficient management, I also have knowledge in latent tools in this area such as JUnit, Git, Linux.... I have also had the opportunity to work with databases such as MySQL and SQL Server, gaining experience in design and data management. <br><br>One of my greatest achievements has been to develop a database management application with a colleague, this in a week without any previous knowledge of the JavaFX framework, which has helped me to improve teamwork, manage time efficiently, improve my learning ability and increase my problem-solving skills. <br><br>I am always open to learn new technologies and programming languages. I firmly believe that one of the most important attributes of a computer scientist is to maintain continuous learning in order to stay updated in such a dynamic field as software development. <br><br>I am excited to be part of the GitHub community and share my projects. Also, I would love to collaborate on open-source projects and learn from other developers. <br><br>Also, this school year 2023/2024, I am highly interested in doing my Erasmus internship, in order to improve my skills as a developer and learn about the cutting-edge technologies latent in Europe.
